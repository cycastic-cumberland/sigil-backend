# Registration

## Email submission

Upon registration, a user shall submit the email address they want to register for.
Regardless of whether the address has been registered or not, backend would always
return the "Success" status. Server will craft a registration URL
using the following parameters:

- `email`: The submitted email address.
- `notValidBefore`: Unix timestamp (UTC+0) before which the URL is invalid.
- `notValidAfter`: Unix timestamp (UTC+0) after which the URL expires.

This URL would be signed by the backend, which add the following parameters:

- `x-pt-signature`: The signature of the URL
- `x-pt-algorithm`: The algorithm used for signing this URL (e.g, `hmac-sha256`, `vault-sha2-384`)

The signed URL is URL-encoded and wrapped into the frontend callback format, then sent to user's email inbox:

```
http[s]://{frontend-origin}/complete-registration?callback={UrlEncodedSignedBackendUrl}
```

## Registration submission

Upon accessing the URL, the frontend would verify whether the user can proceed
or not by using a specified endpoint. The following outcomes are possible:

- The signature verification process failed
- The URL is expired
- The email is used by another user
- This registration request is possible

If the request is possible, the frontend can call the signed URL with user's
details as the request body. User's details must include:

- `firstName`: User's first name.
- `lastName`: User's last name.
- `publicKey`: User's public key (PEM base64 encoded). Created automatically by frontend.
- `kdfParameters`: Encoded KDF parameters used to derive user's key encryption key (KEK).
- `wrappedPrivateKey`: User's enveloped private key. Created automatically by frontend.
- `recoveryKek`: User's KEK, encrypted with backend's public key. This property is optional.

Aside from these properties, users are required to enter their master password.
Master passwords must contain at least 8 characters, 1 upper case character,
1 lower case character, 1 number and 1 special character. This password
is not submitted as part of the registration process, instead frontend
would use this, along with its own key derivation function (KDF) parameters, salt and KDF algorithm
to derive the final user's KEK.

Currently, backend only support `argon2id` KDF algorithm. Any other
type of function would be rejected.

The `kdfParameters` property is created using the following template:

```
{algorithm}${base64EncodedSalt}${base64EncodedAlgorithmSpecificParameters}
```

- `algorithm`: The algorithm used to derive the KEK
- `base64EncodedSalt`: Base64-encoded salt. Empty if none.
- `base64EncodedAlgorithmSpecificParameters`: Any other algorithm-specific parameters. Base64 encoded.

Upon submission, frontend would calculate its own RSA key pair, using
OAEP with SHA-256 and MGF1 padding scheme. The private key shall be encrypted 
using user's KEK. 

The `wrappedPrivateKey` would be created using the `Cipher` entity format 
(described in specification `1. Users, tenants and partitions`). The `cipher` sub-property
would be created by encrypting the private key using AES-256-GCM with 96-bit nonce, which is included in
the `iv` sub-property.

If the user consent, the frontend can encrypt their KEK with backend published RSA-2048 public key
and sent as `recoveryKek`.
This would help users to recover their private key in case they lost the KEK.

### Argon2id specific parameters

In `argon2id` mode, the algorithm-specific parameters are encoded as a 12-byte buffer, then base64-encoded.
The structure is as follows:
- Bytes 0-3: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing parallelism.
- Bytes 4-7: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing number of passes.
- Bytes 8-12: Unsigned 32-bit integer representing memory cost in KiB.

All integers are encoded in little-endian byte order.

## Registration completion

Upon submission, the backend would verify URL signature and request validity.
It would try to insert the user's details to the database, but may fail if the email has been used.

The server have no way to verify if the submitted `publicKey` and `wrappedPrivateKey` is of the same pair,
so any discrepancy would lead to user's lost of data. If `recoveryKek` is included, the backend would
decrypt it using its private key, decrypt the wrapped private key with KEK,
then encrypt it with provider specific key management service (e.g, Hashicorp Vault),
and finally store the cipher text in its database.


# Login

## Overview

The system does not store user passwords (even in hashed form).
Instead, authentication is performed via asymmetric cryptography, using a user-supplied RSA key pair
The user derives a KEK from their password using a KDF,
which is used to decrypt their private key locally.

## Requesting KDF parameters

The frontend initiates login by requesting the KDF parameters and cryptographic metadata associated with the user's email address.
Example response with `argon2id`:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "argon2id",
  "parameters": {
    "parallelism": 1,
    "memoryKb": 32768,
    "iterations": 3
  },
  "salt": "<Base64 encoded salt>",
  "wrappedUserKey": {
    "decryptionMethod": "USER_PASSWORD",
    "kid": "<Base64 encoded key ID>",
    "iv": "<Base64 encoded nonce>",
    "cipher": "<Base64 encoded encrypted private key>"
  },
  "signatureVerificationWindow": 3
}
```

Properties:
- `algorithm`: The KDF algorithm used to derive KEK
- `parameters`: Specific KDF parameters
- `salt`: Base64-encoded salt
- `wrappedUserKey`: Cipher entity containing encrypted private key details
- `signatureVerificationWindow`: Anti-replay time step

To prevent account enumeration, the backend will return a consistent response for any email address,
regardless of whether the user is registered. Specifically, the following fields
will always be identical for a given email:
- 
- `salt`
- `parameters`
- `wrappedUserKey.kid`
- `wrappedUserKey.iv`
- `wrappedUserKey.cipher`

These values are deterministically derived using backend masking keys and salts.
The following backend configuration values are required to enable this feature:
- `application.auth.kdf.maskingKey`: Used to derive consistent KDF salt and KEK.
- `application.auth.kdf.maskingRsaPublicKey`: Used by the actual login process to enable constant time login.
- `application.auth.kdf.maskingRsaPrivateKey`: Used to derive a stable `cipher` and provide constant time operation.

### Key derivation

To produce deterministic, non-reversible KDF salt and KEK,
the backend uses the following HKDF-based derivation:

```
HKDF(length: desiredLength, ikm: userEmail, salt: maskingKey)
```

## Login

To login, the frontend would attempt to decrypt its user's private key locally
using the password derived KEK. On success, it would sign the following login payload:

```
{normalizedEmail}:{timeStep}
```

- `normalizedEmail`: User's email in all uppercase.
- `timeStep`: Time step derived from current Unix timestamp (UTC+0) and `signatureVerificationWindow`.
Calculated using `floor(unix / signatureVerificationWindow)`.

Frontend would then submit its login payload and signature to the backend.
Backend would retrieve the user record from database using the submitted normalized email.
Whether the user exists or not, all of these steps would happen sequentially:
- Signature verification: If user does not exist or signature is invalid,
backend would verify a fake (or submitted) signature using `application.auth.kdf.maskingRsaPublicKey`.
- Payload verification using user's public key: If verification failed, backend would continue with the next step, but return an error at the end.
- Time step verification: Backend would derive its own time step with a preset `signatureVerificationWindow` (that the frontend receive in the KDF parameters request).
Backend time step must be equal or one unit greater than the submitted time step.
Should this step fail, backend would continue with the next step, but return an error at the end.
- Backend would generate and sign a JWT authentication and complete the request.

- If all steps are completed successfully, the backend would return the final JWT payload.
